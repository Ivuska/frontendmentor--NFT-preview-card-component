## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Pseudo-element
- pseudo-class
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I tried to use pseudo-elements with pseudo-classes and trained flex-box in which I have almost lost myself.

I also saw some useful videos and learned a lot context about CSS itself. 

### Continued development

I got almost totally lost in flexbox so I need to practice, practice and practice. 
Globally I need, plan and I am looking forward to the next frontendmentor challenges :-D 
I also plan to see some videos about some tips and good practices in CSS and HTML itself (I found out that many things can be made 'only' with CSS, without using JS.)

I met with Kevin Powell's video thanks to an recommendation from @pazspera and I found them really great and well understandable.I am well aware that I need a lot of practice but thanks to his videos i think and trust that I understand at least the basics rules of this topic.
